-   The challenge

Alura introduces a challenge to it's students frequently, to test their gained habilities throught their courses.
This was a project developed in the front-end edition of the challenge.
The challenge is about a content producer that needed an online code editor to post code snipets in social media.
Asked functionalities were:

-   A field to select the code language
-   A field to write the code
-   A button to visualize the code with syntax highlight
-   A pretty theme
-   Be responsive

Alura provided a doc in Figma with the UX Guide.

-   My approach

I decided to use React in this project for several reasons:

1. Easy
2. Highly maintainable (when correctly done)
3. Globally used, which means, a lot of libraries to use
4. I already worked with it in the past
